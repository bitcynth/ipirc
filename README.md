# IP over IRC

This is so extremely awful and cursed but I did it anyways :p

You can follow me on Twitter [@bitcynth](https://twitter.com/bitcynth) for more of these terrible things.

### Concept

This terrible thing is an TUN interface that uses base64 encoded IRC messages as the "cable"...

### Credits
[Benjojo](https://twitter.com/Benjojo12) for joking about it which gave me the idea.
